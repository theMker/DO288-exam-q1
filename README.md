# Apache HTTP Server (httpd) S2I Sample Application

This is a very basic sample application repository that can be built and deployed
on [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com).

The application serves a single static html page via httpd.

You will need the template file from Michael Clarkson to run this. If you are here for the exam, he's already given it to you. Good luck!
